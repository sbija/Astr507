# Particles in a Box
This is a template for completing the first ASTR507 problem set. It is meant as a starting point for the homework to make it slightly more manageable and provide some structure.

Here's how you can get started using this

0. [Ensure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed]
1. Click the green "Use this template" button to create your open copy of this repository
2. Clone your copy of the repository to your local machine ([GitHub cloning help](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
3. Create a new conda environment for the class (this makes sure you have all of the necessary packages installed) by running the following **from within the cloned repository folder**

``` conda env create -f environment.yml ```

4. Activate that environment by running

``` conda activate astr507 ```

5. Open Jupyter Lab by running

``` jupyter lab ```

6. Edit `solutions.ipynb` and `simulator.py` (plus `test_simulator.py` probably) and send your notebook in to Eric when you're done!

7. Celebrate!
