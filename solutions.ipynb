Compute the mean pressure by calculating the force per length (since 2-D) on each (or just one) side of your box.  You can do this by using the definition of pressure:  force divided by length (in 2-D), and compute the forces of each particle as it reflects off of each side (if you have periodic boundary conditions, then keep track of the momentum perpendicular to the edges as the particles jump from one side of the box to the other). The average force imparted is the average change in momentum of the particle as they reflect (or twice the momentum perpendicular to the side) divided by the average time between collisions."
